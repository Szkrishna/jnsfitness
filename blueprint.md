# Project Blueprint

## Purpose and Capabilities

This project is a web application built with React. The goal is to create a modern and visually appealing user interface for a basic accommodation and fitness website. The AI assistant will iteratively develop the application based on user requests, following modern React and web development best practices.

## Project Outline

### Initial Version (v0.1)

*   **Framework:** React (Vite)
*   **Styling:** CSS with a default dark theme.
*   **Fonts:** System default fonts.
*   **Components:** Default `App.jsx` component.

### Version (v0.4)

*   **Styling:**
    *   **Enhanced Dark Theme:** A modern, visually rich dark theme has been implemented with a fullscreen background.
    *   **Fonts:** 'Montserrat' imported from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look.
    *   **Title Styling:** The main title "JNS Fitness" has been styled with a vibrant color gradient.
*   **Components:** `App.jsx` has a basic structure with a card, title, text, and button.

## Current Change: Title Gradient

### Plan

1.  **Update `blueprint.md` to document the title styling change.**
2.  **Modify `src/App.css` to apply a gradient to the `h1` element.**
    *   Apply a linear gradient background to the `h1`.
    *   Use `background-clip: text` and `text-fill-color: transparent` to make the text show the gradient.
